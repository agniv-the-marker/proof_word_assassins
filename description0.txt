Hi everyone!!

I, along with Fiona and Sidhant and James, decided to run a game of Word Assassins, except with a bit of a twist. Each day every person will receive by email a list of three people with three words. The rules of the game are as follows:

- At any given time, your targets and words are those from the most recent email. Any previous emails become irrelevant.
- Words are not repeated between people or between days.
- If your target says the word (or any form of the word, not including compound words), you win 1 point, and your target loses 1/3 points. For example, if your word is "sleep", you win if your target says "sleeping" or "slept" or "sleeps" (forms of the word "sleep"), but not if your target says "sleepwalking" (compound word).
- Your maximum number of points per day is 3, if you can get each target to say each specific word, and you don't say the words that your assassins want to get to you to say.
- If someone reports that you are only talking to your targets and not anyone else, we will impose a technical foul which is worth -2 points. So therefore you should still talk to people in normal conversations.
- TO OFFICIATE YOUR POINTS: Please write on the discord channel #word-assassins the following sentence, with the brackets filled in:
    - @[TARGET_DISCORD_USERNAME] I got [TARGET_NAME] to say the word [TARGET_WORD]
- At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the most points. They receive a virtual plaque on the inaugural ASPR hall of fame. And the joy of winning (according to Fiona).
- Be a good sport. Talk to your target if they say the word to make sure you guys are on the same page please. 

Have fun!
Max, Fiona, Sidhant, James
