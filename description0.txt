Hi everyone!!

I am stealing this game from ASPR, which is called Word Assassins, with the following rules. TL;DR, Each day every person will receive by email a list of three people with three words. The rules of the game are as follows:

- At any given time, your targets and words are those from the most recent email. Any previous emails become irrelevant.
- Words are not repeated between people or between days.
- If your target says the word (or any form of the word, not including compound words), you win 1 point, and your target loses 1/3 points. For example, if your word is "sleep", you win if your target says "sleeping" or "slept" or "sleeps" (forms of the word "sleep"), but not if your target says "sleepwalking" (compound word).
- Your maximum number of points per day is 3, if you can get each target to say each specific word, and you don't say the words that your assassins want to get to you to say.
- If someone reports that you are only talking to your targets and not anyone else, we will impose a technical foul which is worth -2 points. So therefore you should still talk to people in normal conversations.
- TO OFFICIATE YOUR POINTS: Please email me with the following subject line (talk about yourself in the 3rd person):
    - [ASSASSIN_NAME] got [TARGET_NAME] to say the word [TARGET_WORD] 
- At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the most points. They receive a virtual plaque on the inaugural Proof hall of fame. And the joy of winning.
- Be a good sport. Talk to your target if they say the word to make sure you guys are on the same page please!

Finally, there are some rules/game types that can be introduced (i.e. Vengence, Shielding, Kamikaze), but this will be done later on instead just to keep things simple for now. Those rules are here:

- Kamikaze agents are those who any assassin can target (you can swap your target to one), but these agents get a list of everyone, each with their own word. They get scored based on the NUMBER of people they get to say the word. My current record is 18 in a single day, try and beat it! If someone wants to join a game midday, they can opt into being a Kamikaze agent instead of waiting for the next day.
- [VENGEANCE RULE] From now on, if you kill someone who has previously killed you, that's 2 points. Please label your  message with the term VENGEANCE at the front to get the additional point.
- [SHIELD OPPORTUNITIES] Everyone has three opportunities in a day to ask the question of the form "Are you trying to get me to say the word X?" (or similar). If you ask this question to your assassin and X is indeed the word that your assassin is trying to get you to say, your assassin loses 1/3 a point and you win a point, and they can no longer kill you. Please label the email with the term SUCCESSFUL SHIELD. Otherwise, you simply lose of your three opportunities in the day, and the game continues as normal.

If anyone wants to join, please make sure they ask me! If you wish to opt out, please let me know. Running multiple groups is probably possible, but half of the fun is making you talk to new people! If you have an idea on how to automate the scoring, please let me know! I imagine google forms might work...

Have fun!
