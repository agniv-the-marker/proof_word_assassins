Hey!

Sophia has left the game! Points for her still count. Zane and Thomas have joined! No new rules yet, happy hunting!

For those new, the rules are simple:

- If you get your target to say a word aloud, you get 1 point.
- If you say a word someone is trying to get you to say, you lose 1/3rd of a point.

I'm currently considering adding a rule where if you get 3/3 in a single day you get an extra half point. Text thoughts on this!

Current leaderboard:

1. 
2. 
3. 

Again, once the first person gets to 12 points, I will introduce SHIELDING. At 21, I will introduce VENEGENCE.

Thanks,

Agniv Sarkar
