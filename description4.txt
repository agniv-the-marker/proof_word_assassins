Hey hunters,

Thanks for a good day of hunting! Allie is joining this game. For a quick recap of the rules:

For those new, the rules are simple:

- If you get your target to say a word aloud, you get 1 point.
- If you say a word someone is trying to get you to say, you lose 1/3rd of a point.
- Let me know if you got someone inside of the group chat! Say "I got [X] with word [Y]"

Links are in group chat description.
