Hullaballo hunters!

Scroll down to see targets.

Updates that should've been yesterday:
- Rivka is awesome
- Killstreak bonus has been implemented! For each time you kill 3 people in a day, you get an extra point!
- Kamikaze is now mandatory for the #1 person on Fridays (they will recieve a special email tomorrow).


// if no one new joining, remove rules

Some shields went down! Also, X is joining this game. For a quick recap of the rules:

For those new, the rules are simple:

- If you get your target to say a word aloud, you get 1 point.
- If you say a word someone is trying to get you to say, you lose 1/3rd of a point.
- Let me know if you got someone inside of the group chat! Say "I got [X] with word [Y]"

Links are in group chat description. Text in the group chat for words that you want added.

How SHIELDING works:

- If you think you know your assassin's word, look at them and say "Is your word for me [X]?" or something similar. Saying shield gives you a bonus point (in my heart)
- If you get it right, then you gain a third of a point and they lose a third of a point. They cannot kill you for the rest of the day.
- If you get it wrong, then you cannot invoke a shield for the rest of the day. No points are affected.

Be careful! Denote in chat "SUCCESSFUL SHIELD against [assassin]" so I know how to document it.
