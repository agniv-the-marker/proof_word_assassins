Hullaballo hunters & shielders!

Scroll down to see targets. Some shields went down, so keep it up!

Updates that should've been yesterday:
- Rivka is awesome (this is everyday)
- Killstreak bonus has been implemented! For each time you kill 3 people in a day, you get an extra point!
- Kamikaze is now mandatory for the #1 person on Fridays (they will recieve a special email tomorrow). It is still opt-inable.

Short explanation of Kamikaze:
- You do this for the day instead of having three people.
- You get a list of EVERYONE playing and a word for them (here, words can be shorter to make it easier.)
- You earn a percentage. If you kill x% of people, you get x% * 3.
- Shielding still works against you, but you only lose 1/10th of a point if it is successful. Similarly, they gain 1/10th of a point.
- For each person you kill, they each lose 1/10th of a point.

This will also include a seperate leaderboard that is purely based on the NUMBER of kills done in a single day.

Normal Leaderboard:

1.
2. 
3. 

Happy Hunting,
