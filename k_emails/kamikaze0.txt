Rules for KAMIKAZE style:

Remove the name from the `names_emails.csv`. Keeping this manual because I don't think most people want to play this style, although you can also use a `kamikaze_names_emails.csv`.

Then, increase agent number by one in `kamikaze.py` to generate enough data for them. 

Then, send them the CSV directly so they have a full list.
