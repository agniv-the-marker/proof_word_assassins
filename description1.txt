Hi everyone!!

Happy Hunting! I have some new tidbits:

- Mira is now opted out of the game, but points for her still count from yesterday
- I am thinking about making this a *week long game* rather than daily, although with 5 targets instead of 3. Text in the group chat if you want to do this!
- Instead of emailing me, TEXT IN THE JUNIOR GROUP CHAT "[Target name] got with [target word]"
    - this will be more fun! 

Again, just to recap scoring, 1 point for every kill, loss of 1/3 point for every death. You can say the words in their alternate forms (sleep, sleeping, slept, sleeped) but not compounded (sleepwalking, asleep). I'm currently tracking the score in a file, let me know if you guys want this to be public.

Scoreboard:

1. 
2. 
3. 

Have fun!
