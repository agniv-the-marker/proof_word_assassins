Hi everyone!!

Happy Hunting! I have some new tidbits:

- Mira is now opted out of the game, but points for her still count from yesterday
- Trent is now doing KAMIKAZE!
    - He has a list of everyone and a word associated with them to target
    - He doesn't gain or lose points that day, but you can gain points on him by swapping your target onto him.
    - Maximum streak in a day is its own award! My max was 18, but our grade can never beat that... yet.
- I am thinking about making this a *week long game* rather than daily, although with 5 targets instead of 3. Text in the group chat if you want to do this!
- Instead of emailing me, TEXT IN THE JUNIOR GROUP CHAT "[Target name] got with [target word]"
    - this will be more fun! you can see people win in real time
- If your target is absent, let me know, you get a free point. You only get this point if you let me know!
    - To be fair, they cant lose the point that day. 

Again, just to recap scoring, 1 point for every kill, loss of 1/3 point for every death. You can say the words in their alternate forms (sleep, sleeping, slept, sleeped) but not compounded (sleepwalking, asleep). I'm currently tracking the score in a file, let me know if you guys want this to be public.

Again, let me know if you want to try Kamikaze, as the code should work now. Shield and venegence will come into play next week. Finally, I'm gonna get someone to ask the seniors if they want to join, as the week long will probably be better if it has more people.

Scoreboard:

1. 
2. 
3. 

Have fun!
