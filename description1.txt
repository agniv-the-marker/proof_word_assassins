Hi everyone!!

Happy Hunting! I have some new tidbits:

- Mira is now opted out of the game
- Jacob is added!
- Instead of emailing me, TEXT IN THE JUNIOR GROUP CHAT "[Target name] got with [target word]"
    - this will be more fun! you can see people win in real time
- If your target is absent, let me know, you get a free 1/2 point. You only get this point if you let me know!
    - To be fair, they cant lose the point that day. 

Again, just to recap scoring, 1 point for every kill, loss of 1/3 point for every death. You can say the words in their alternate forms (sleep, sleeping, slept, sleeped) but not compounded (sleepwalking, asleep). I'm currently tracking the score in a file, which is shared to the group chat. Thanks to Rivka for making the scoring work out!

Again, let me know if you want to try Kamikaze, as the code should work now. Shield will come into play next week. Finally, I'm gonna get someone to ask the seniors if they want to join, as the week long will probably be better if it has more people.

Scoreboard:

1. Allison (3)
2. Trent (2.6)
3. Lucia (1.3)

Have fun!
