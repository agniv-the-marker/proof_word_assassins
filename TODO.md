# TODO list

## Proof Specific

Need to make this game more suited for the school

- Make there be N days for each day in the block
- Refactor email so it includes who was targetting the previous day

## Code Specific

Need to make this cleaner

- Make adding new people easier, i.e. make it update k - N csvs instead of all of them to maintain old ones, and then have the new ones be with the new people
- Add folders for the emails/data instead of letting it bloat up lol
- Add a csv aimed for targets, i.e. easier to get the data when writing the emails.

## Want to dos?

Maybe make csv generation easier on my end instead of a spreadsheet? Not totally sure how this might work, could host on a website or something (very low priority)
