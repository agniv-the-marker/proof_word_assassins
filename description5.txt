Hey hunters,

SHIELDING will now be introduced. Also, Jasper is joining this game. For a quick recap of the rules:

For those new, the rules are simple:

- If you get your target to say a word aloud, you get 1 point.
- If you say a word someone is trying to get you to say, you lose 1/3rd of a point.
- Let me know if you got someone inside of the group chat! Say "I got [X] with word [Y]"

Links are in group chat description. Text in the group chat for words that you want added.

How SHIELDING works:

- If you think you know your assassin's word, look at them and say "Is your word for me [X]?" or something similar.
- If you get it right, then you gain a half point and they lose a half point.
- If you get it wrong, then you lose a half point and they gain a half point.

You have 3 chances to use this in a day, but if you get it wrong, you lose all your chances to use it for the rest of the day. Be careful!

Denote in chat "SUCCESSFUL SHIELD against [assassin]" or "UNSUCCESSFUL SHIELD against [asssassin]" so I know how to document it.

The live leaderboard is undergoing work by the epic dev Rivka (please pay her money, this is child labor).

Happy Hunting,
